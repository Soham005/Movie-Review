# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis App

This project is a **Movie Review Sentiment Analysis App** built with **Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit**.  
It classifies user-submitted movie reviews as **Positive ðŸ˜Š** or **Negative ðŸ˜ž** in real time.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Takes a userâ€™s movie review as input
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** for feature extraction
- Predicts sentiment using a trained **Machine Learning model**
- Interactive **Streamlit web app** for easy usage

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ ML model & TF-IDF
- **Streamlit** â€“ Frontend for deployment
- **Pandas / NumPy** â€“ Data handling
- **Pickle** â€“ Model persistence

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ app.py # Streamlit app
â”œâ”€â”€ Movie_Reviews.ipynb # Jupyter notebook (training & EDA)
â”œâ”€â”€ IMDB Dataset-2.csv # Dataset (~50,000 reviews)
â”œâ”€â”€ model.pkl # Trained ML model
â”œâ”€â”€ scaler.pkl # TF-IDF vectorizer (saved)

## âš¡ How It Works
1. **Dataset**: IMDB movie reviews (~50k entries)
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning, tokenization, and TF-IDF feature extraction
3. **Model Training**: ML model trained for binary classification
4. **Deployment**: Integrated into a **Streamlit app** for real-time predictions
